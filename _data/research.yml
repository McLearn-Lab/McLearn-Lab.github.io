  - title: Estimating individual differences for student modeling in intelligent tutors from reading and pretest data.

    description: 'Standard Bayesian Knowledge Tracing individualizes parameter estimates for skills, also referred to as knowledge components (KCs), but not for students. Studies deriving individual student parameters from the data logs of student tutor performance have shown improvements to the standard BKT model fits, and result in different practice recommendations for students. This study investigates whether individual student parameters, specifically individual difference weights (IDWs) can be derived from student activities prior to tutor use.'
